# Booking App UI

This project is a React-based user interface for a booking application. The UI provides features such as room booking, service searching, hotel management, user management, and reservation management.



## Features

- **Room Service:** Allows users to browse and book available rooms.
- **Search Service:** Enables users to search for services, rooms, or hotels based on different criteria.
- **Hotel Service:** Manages hotel details including room availability, pricing, and special offers.
- **User Service:** Handles user registration, login, profile management, and booking history.
- **Reserve Service:** Manages reservation details including booking confirmation, modification, and cancellation.



## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/booking-app-ui.git
   cd booking-app-ui
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

   ```

   This will start the React development server and open the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

### Development

- **Running the App:** Use `npm start` to run the app in development mode. The app will reload automatically if you make edits to the code.
- **Building the App:** Use `npm run build` to build the app for production. The build will be optimized, and the output will be in the `build/` directory.

### Deployment

To deploy the app, you can use services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. The production-ready build can be created using `npm run build`, which can then be deployed to your preferred hosting service.
